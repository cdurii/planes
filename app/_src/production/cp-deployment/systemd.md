It's recommended to use a process manager like systemd when using {{ site.mesh_product_name }} on VMs. 
Here are examples of systemd configurations

## kuma-cp

```systemd
[Unit]
Description = {{ site.mesh_product_name }} Control Plane
After = network.target
Documentation = {{ site.links.web }}

[Service]
User = < user to use to run the process >
WorkingDirectory = <directory of the {{ site.mesh_product_name}} install >
ExecStart = ./bin/kuma-cp run --config-file=./cp-config.yaml
# if you need your Control Plane to be able to handle a non-trivial number of concurrent connections
# (a total of both incoming and outgoing connections), you need to set proper resource limits on
# the `kuma-cp` process, especially maximum number of open files.
#
# it happens that `systemd` units are not affected by the traditional `ulimit` configuration,
# and you must set resource limits as part of `systemd` unit itself.
#
# to check effective resource limits set on a running `kuma-cp` instance, execute
#
#   $ cat /proc/$(pgrep kuma-cp)/limits
#
#   Limit                     Soft Limit           Hard Limit           Units
#   ...
#   Max open files            1024                 4096                 files
#   ...
#
# for Kuma demo setup, we chose the same limit as `docker` and `containerd` set by default.
# See https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/3201
LimitNOFILE = 1048576
Restart = always
RestartSec = 1s
# disable rate limiting on start attempts
StartLimitIntervalSec = 0
StartLimitBurst = 0

[Install]
WantedBy = multi-user.target
```

## kuma-dp

```systemd
[Unit]
Description = {{ site.mesh_product_name }} Data Plane Proxy
After = network.target
Documentation = {{ site.links.web }}

[Service]
User = < user to use to run the process >
WorkingDirectory = <directory of the {{ site.mesh_product_name}} install >
ExecStart = ./bin/kuma-dp run \
  --cp-address=https://<kuma-cp-address>:5678 \
  --dataplane-token-file=./echo-service-universal.token \
  --dataplane-file=./dataplane-notransparent.yaml \
  --ca-cert-file=./ca.pem
Restart = always
RestartSec = 1s
# disable rate limiting on start attempts
StartLimitIntervalSec = 0
StartLimitBurst = 0

[Install]
WantedBy = multi-user.target
```
